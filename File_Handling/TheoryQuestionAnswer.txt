✅ 1) What is File Handling?
📘 Definition

File Handling is the process of creating, reading, writing, and deleting files in Java to store data permanently.

🧠 Why needed?

Data should not be lost when program stops

Database is not always required

Logs, reports, configurations need files

🌍 Real-Time Example

📄 Marks card / Resume

Written once

Read many times

Stored permanently

🎯 Interview Line

File handling allows Java programs to store and retrieve data from files permanently.

✅ 2) What is File class?
📘 Definition

File class represents a file or directory path in Java.

⚠️ Important:

It does NOT read or write data

It only gives information about file

🌍 Real-Time Example

📍 Google Maps location
You know where the house is, not what’s inside.

🎯 Interview Line

File class is used to represent file or directory paths and to get file-related information.

✅ 3) Methods available in File class
Method	Purpose
createNewFile()	Creates new file
exists()	Checks file exists
delete()	Deletes file
mkdir()	Creates directory
length()	File size
getName()	File name
getPath()	Path
isFile()	Is file?
isDirectory()	Is directory?
🌍 Example

🗂 Checking if folder exists before saving file

✅ 4) What is FileReader and FileWriter?
FileReader

Reads character data

Used for text files

FileWriter

Writes character data

Overwrites by default

🌍 Real-Time Example

📖 Reading book (FileReader)
✍️ Writing notes (FileWriter)

🎯 Interview Line

FileReader reads character data from files and FileWriter writes character data into files.

✅ 5) How to read data from a File?
Ways:

FileReader

BufferedReader

Scanner

🌍 Real-Time Example

📖 Reading a letter line by line

Interview Tip

BufferedReader is preferred for performance.

✅ 6) How to write data into File?
Ways:

FileWriter

BufferedWriter

PrintWriter

🌍 Real-Time Example

✍️ Writing diary

Important

Use flush() or close()

Otherwise data may not be saved

✅ 7) BufferedReader vs FileReader
FileReader	BufferedReader
Reads character by character	Reads line by line
Slow	Fast
No buffering	Uses buffer
Low performance	High performance
🌍 Real-Time Example

🚶 Walking one step vs 🚗 traveling in car

🎯 Interview Line

BufferedReader is faster than FileReader because it reads data in chunks.

✅ 8) Copy data from one file to another
🌍 Real-Time Example

📄 Photocopy document

Logic

Read from source file

Write into destination file

🎯 Interview Line

File copy is done by reading data from one file and writing it into another file using streams.

✅ 9) Read data from two files and write into another file
🌍 Real-Time Example

📑 Merge two reports into one final report

Logic

Read File-1

Read File-2

Write both into File-3

✅ 10) Count number of words in a file
🌍 Real-Time Example

📝 Checking word count in assignment

Logic

Read line

Split by space

Count words

🎯 Interview Line

Word count is done by reading file line by line and splitting using space delimiter.

✅ 11) What is Scanner class?
📘 Definition

Scanner is used to read input from:

Keyboard

File

String

🌍 Real-Time Example

📝 Online form input

Difference from BufferedReader

Scanner is easy

BufferedReader is faster

🎯 Interview Line

Scanner is used to read formatted input from different sources.

✅ 12) What is Serializable interface?
📘 Definition

Serializable is a marker interface used to indicate that an object can be converted into byte stream.

🌍 Real-Time Example

📦 Packing object into box for transport

🎯 Interview Line

Serializable allows Java objects to be converted into a stream for storage or transfer.

✅ 13) What is Serialization?
📘 Definition

Serialization is the process of converting an object into byte stream.

🌍 Real-Time Example

💾 Saving game progress

Why?

Store object in file

Send object over network

🎯 Interview Line

Serialization converts object state into byte stream for persistence.

✅ 14) What is De-Serialization?
📘 Definition

De-serialization is the process of converting byte stream back into object.

🌍 Real-Time Example

🎮 Loading saved game

🎯 Interview Line

De-serialization reconstructs object from byte stream.

✅ 15) What is serialVersionUID?
📘 Definition

serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for Serializable class.

Why needed?

Ensures class compatibility during deserialization

Prevents InvalidClassException

🌍 Real-Time Example

📦 Parcel version number

🎯 Interview Line

serialVersionUID ensures compatibility between serialized object and class.

✅ 16) What is transient keyword?
📘 Definition

transient prevents a variable from being serialized.

🌍 Real-Time Example

🔐 Password should not be saved

🎯 Interview Line

transient keyword is used to exclude sensitive data from serialization.

🏁 FINAL INTERVIEW MEMORY TRICK
File → path
Reader/Writer → data
Buffered → fast
Serializable → object to file
transient → hide data
