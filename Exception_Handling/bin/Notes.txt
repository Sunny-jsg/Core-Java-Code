✅ 1) What is a package and why do we need packages?

A package in Java is a folder-like structure used to group related classes and interfaces.

Why we need packages

To avoid name conflicts (e.g., two classes with same name in different packages)

To organize code (like folders in a project)

To provide access protection

For modular development (easy to maintain large projects)

✅ 2) What is Import in Java?

import is a keyword used to access a class from another package.

Example:

import java.util.Scanner;


Without import, you would need to write:

java.util.Scanner sc = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);

✅ 3) What is static import?

Static import allows you to access static members (variables/methods) of a class without using class name.

Example:

import static java.lang.Math.*;
System.out.println(sqrt(25));  // no need Math.sqrt()

✅ 4) What is a Wrapper Class?

Wrapper classes convert primitive types → objects.

Examples:

Primitive	Wrapper
int	Integer
double	Double
boolean	Boolean
char	Character
✅ 5) When we have primitives, why use wrapper classes?

We need wrapper classes because:

Collections (ArrayList, HashMap) cannot store primitives

Useful for type conversion (e.g., String → Integer)

Required for serialization

Required for reflection

Support utility methods (Integer.parseInt(), etc.)

✅ 6) What is Auto Boxing and Auto Unboxing?

Auto-boxing: primitive → wrapper object

Integer i = 10; // int → Integer


Auto-unboxing: wrapper object → primitive

int a = i; // Integer → int

✅ 7) What is Exception Hierarchy in Java?
Throwable
   |
   |-- Exception
   |      |-- RuntimeException (Unchecked)
   |      |-- Other Exceptions (Checked)
   |
   |-- Error (Not meant to handle)

✅ 8) Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions
Checked Exceptions

Checked at compile time

Must be handled using try/catch or throws

Examples: IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException

Unchecked Exceptions

Occur at runtime

No need to handle

Examples: NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

✅ 9) How to handle exceptions?

Three ways:

try-catch

throws

try-with-resources

✅ 10) What is try-catch-finally?
try

Contains risky code

catch

Handles the exception

finally

Executes always, used to close connections/resources

Example:

try {
   int a = 10/0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
   System.out.println("Error");
} finally {
   System.out.println("Always executes");
}

✅ 11) Difference between throws and throw
throw	throws
Used to throw exception manually	Used in method signature
Occurs inside method body	Occurs at method declaration
Throws only one exception at a time	Can declare multiple exceptions
Example: throw new AgeException()	Example: public void m() throws IOException
✅ 12) What is try-with-resources?

Used to auto close resources like File, Scanner, Connection.
Resource MUST implement AutoCloseable.

Example:

try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("abc.txt")) {
    // automatic closing
}

✅ 13) Why write multiple catch blocks? Any alternative?
Why multiple catch?

To handle different exceptions separately.

Alternative

Use multi-catch:

catch(IOException | SQLException e)

✅ 14) How to create and throw User Defined Exception?
Step 1: Create class
class AgeInvalidException extends Exception {
    public AgeInvalidException(String msg) {
        super(msg);
    }
}

Step 2: Throw manually
if(age < 18)
    throw new AgeInvalidException("Age must be 18+");

✅ 15) JVM behavior when Runtime Exception occurs

If runtime exception is not handled:

JVM stops program execution

JVM prints:

Exception name

Cause/message

Stack trace (error location)

✅ 16) What is Exception Re-throw?

Throwing an exception again after catching it.

Example:

try {
   // code
} catch(Exception e) {
   throw e; // re-throwing
}


Used when a method wants to log exception but let the caller handle it.

✅ 17) Few Checked Exceptions

IOException

SQLException

ClassNotFoundException

FileNotFoundException

InterruptedException

✅ 18) Few Unchecked Exceptions

NullPointerException

ArithmeticException

NumberFormatException

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

ClassCastException

✅ 19) Program that gives StackOverflowError
Example (infinite recursion)
public class Test {
    public static void m() {
        m();  // calling itself repeatedly
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        m();
    }
}

✅ 20) Difference between final, finally, finalize()
Keyword	Meaning
final	Used with variable/method/class (constant, non-overridable, non-inheritable)
finally	Block executed always after try/catch
finalize()	Method used by Garbage Collector before destroying object (deprecated)
