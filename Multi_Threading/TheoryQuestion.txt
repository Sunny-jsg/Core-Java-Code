✅ 1) What is Multithreading?
📘 Definition

Multithreading is the ability of a program to execute multiple threads simultaneously to perform multiple tasks at the same time.

🧠 Simple words

One program → many small workers (threads) → work together.

🌍 Real-time Example

📱 WhatsApp

One thread → sending message

One thread → receiving message

One thread → notifications
All work at the same time.

🎯 Interview line

Multithreading allows concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program to improve performance.

✅ 2) Why do we need Multithreading?
📘 Reasons

Better CPU utilization

Faster execution

Responsive applications

Handle multiple tasks at once

🌍 Real-time Example

🖥 Browser

One tab loading

Another tab scrolling

Music playing
Without multithreading → browser freezes.

🎯 Interview line

Multithreading improves application performance and responsiveness.

✅ 3) What is Thread Scheduler?
📘 Definition

Thread Scheduler is a JVM component that decides which thread runs next.

🧠 Important

Scheduling is not predictable

Depends on JVM + OS

🌍 Real-time Example

🎟 Airport security

Many passengers (threads)

Officer (scheduler) decides who goes next

🎯 Interview line

Thread Scheduler controls execution order of threads.

✅ 4) What is Thread Priority?
📘 Definition

Thread priority tells the scheduler which thread is more important.

🔢 Range

MIN_PRIORITY = 1

NORM_PRIORITY = 5 (default)

MAX_PRIORITY = 10

🌍 Real-time Example

🚑 Ambulance vs bike

Ambulance has higher priority

⚠️ Important

Priority is a hint, not a guarantee.

🎯 Interview line

Thread priority influences scheduling but does not guarantee execution order.

✅ 5) What is Thread Life Cycle?
📘 States

New

Runnable

Running

Waiting / Blocked

Terminated

🌍 Real-time Example

🎓 Student life

Admission → studying → exam → result

🎯 Interview line

Thread lifecycle defines different states of a thread from creation to termination.

✅ 6) How to create Thread?
📘 Two ways

Extend Thread class

Implement Runnable interface (recommended)

🌍 Real-time Example

👷 Hiring workers

Extending Thread → worker with fixed job

Runnable → worker can do different jobs

🎯 Interview line

Threads can be created by extending Thread or implementing Runnable.

✅ 7) Difference between start() and run()
start()	run()
Creates new thread	No new thread
Calls run internally	Normal method
Parallel execution	Sequential
🌍 Real-time Example

☎️ Dialing number (start) vs talking (run)

🎯 Interview line

start() creates a new thread, run() executes like a normal method.

✅ 8) Thread vs Runnable
Thread	Runnable
Class	Interface
No multiple inheritance	Supports multiple inheritance
Heavy	Lightweight
🌍 Real-time Example

👨‍🍳 Thread = chef
📄 Runnable = recipe

🎯 Interview line

Runnable is preferred because it supports multiple inheritance and better design.

✅ 9) Runnable vs Callable
Runnable	Callable
No return value	Returns value
Cannot throw checked exception	Can throw
run()	call()
🌍 Real-time Example

🧾 Runnable → worker reports verbally
📊 Callable → worker submits written report

🎯 Interview line

Callable is used when we need return value from thread.

✅ 10) What is Synchronization?
📘 Definition

Synchronization ensures only one thread accesses critical section at a time.

🌍 Real-time Example

🚽 One restroom, many people → lock system

🎯 Interview line

Synchronization prevents race condition and ensures data consistency.

✅ 11) Synchronized Method vs Synchronized Block
Method	Block
Locks entire method	Locks specific code
Slower	Faster
Less control	More control
🌍 Real-time Example

🔒 Lock entire house vs lock only locker

🎯 Interview line

Synchronized block is preferred for performance.

✅ 12) What is Deadlock?
📘 Definition

Deadlock occurs when two threads wait for each other forever.

🌍 Real-time Example

🧍 Person A holds pen, wants paper
🧍 Person B holds paper, wants pen
→ Deadlock

🎯 Interview line

Deadlock is a situation where threads wait indefinitely for each other’s resources.

✅ 13) Java Program which gives Deadlock (Concept)
Thread-1: lock A → wait for B
Thread-2: lock B → wait for A

🎯 Interview explanation

Deadlock occurs due to circular wait and improper lock ordering.

✅ 14) What is Inter-Thread Communication?
📘 Definition

Threads communicate using wait(), notify(), notifyAll().

🌍 Real-time Example

👨‍💼 Manager waits for report
👨‍💻 Employee notifies after completion

🎯 Interview line

Inter-thread communication allows threads to coordinate execution.

✅ 15) What is Producer–Consumer Problem?
📘 Concept

Producer produces data

Consumer consumes data

Shared buffer

Uses wait() & notify()

🌍 Real-time Example

🍽 Restaurant

Chef cooks

Waiter serves

If food not ready → waiter waits

🎯 Interview line

Producer–Consumer problem demonstrates thread coordination using wait and notify.

✅ 16) What is Executor Framework?
📘 Definition

Executor Framework manages thread creation, reuse, and scheduling automatically.

🌍 Real-time Example

👔 Company HR

You submit work

HR assigns employee

You don’t manage workers

🎯 Interview line

Executor Framework simplifies multithreading by managing thread pools efficiently.

🏁 FINAL INTERVIEW TIP (IMPORTANT)

If interviewer asks “Explain multithreading”, say:

Multithreading allows a program to execute multiple tasks concurrently using threads, improving performance, responsiveness, and efficient resource utilization.
